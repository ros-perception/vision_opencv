1.12.7 (2017-11-12)
-------------------

1.12.6 (2017-11-11)
-------------------
* fix endianness issues
* Contributors: Vincent Rabaud

1.12.5 (2017-11-05)
-------------------
* add version_gte for opencv3
  @vrabaud If you'll update opencv3 version as discussed in https://discourse.ros.org/t/opencv-3-3/2674/4, I think we'd better to add 'version_gte' tag so that apt-get install ros-kinetic-cv-bridge also pulls openv3.3 from repository, to avoid API breaking issue between opencv2 and opencv3.
* Simplify the dependency components of cv_bridge
  Fixes `#183 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/issues/183>`_
* Fixes `#177 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/issues/177>`_
  The Python bridge was wrong on OpenCV2 with mono8 (and any Mat
  with only two dimensions btw). Took the official Python bridge
  from OpenCV.
* Add missing test file
  This fixes `#171 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/issues/171>`_
* Properly deal with alpha in image compression.
  That fixes `#169 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/issues/169>`_
* Silence warnings about un-used variables
* export OpenCV variables
* Contributors: Kei Okada, Victor Lamoine, Vincent Rabaud

1.12.4 (2017-01-29)
-------------------
* properly find Boost Python 2 or 3
  This fixes `#158 <https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/issues/158>`_
* Contributors: Vincent Rabaud

1.12.3 (2016-12-04)
-------------------
* Use api in sensor_msgs to get byte_depth and num channels
* Implement cpp conversion of N channel image
  This is cpp version of https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/pull/141,
  which is one for python.
* Fill black color to depth nan region
* address gcc6 build error in cv_bridge and tune
  With gcc6, compiling fails with `stdlib.h: No such file or directory`,
  as including '-isystem /usr/include' breaks with gcc6, cf.,
  https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70129
  This commit addresses this issue for cv_bridge in the same way
  it was done in the commit ead421b8 [1] for image_geometry.
  This issue was also addressed in various other ROS packages.
