<!-- 
In addition to providing an overview of your package,
this is the section where the specification and design/architecture 
should be detailed. While the original specification may be done on the
wiki, it should be transferred here once your package starts to take shape.
You can then link to this documentation page from the Wiki.

\section codeapi Code API

<!--
Provide links to specific auto-generated API documentation within your
package that is of particular interest to a reader. Doxygen will
document pretty much every part of your code, so do your best here to
point the reader to the actual API.

If your codebase is fairly large or has different sets of APIs, you
should use the doxygen 'group' tag to keep these APIs together. For
example, the roscpp documentation has 'libros' group.
-->

\section rosapi ROS API

<!--
Names are very important in ROS because they can be remapped on the
command-line, so it is VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU LIST NAMES AS THEY
APPEAR IN THE CODE. You should list names of every topic, service and
parameter used in your code. There is a template below that you can
use to document each node separately.

List of nodes:
- \b node_name1
- \b node_name2
-->
